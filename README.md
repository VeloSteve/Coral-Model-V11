## Coral-Model-V11

## Synopsis

* This coral model was developed by Cheryl Logan and extended by Steve Ryan
* It simulates coral survival over time and under a range of climate scenarios.
* The first big changes after beginning source code control will be here.
* The goal is to refactor so that the biological simulation, the analysis of the results, and the generation if figures are more separate.
